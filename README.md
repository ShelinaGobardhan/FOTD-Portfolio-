From Objects to Data Portfolio.
Our group consists of the following memebers: Anne Marie Adriaanse-Teeuw, Emma van Asbeck, Shelina Gobardhan and Nadine Groffen.

The focus of our project is finding out how movies adapted from books differ from the book itself. To do this we use data sets that contain the full 'Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban' book and the complete movie script of its movie adaptation.
